\chapter{\abstractname}

\paragraph{Good software architecture documentation is the starting of a good software practise that makes the software itself more maintainable, extendable and sustainable over its extended lifetime and evolution. Complex open-source software that grow exponentially with time require this documentation to serve its  knowledge sharing purpose for new developers, communicate software architectural rationale to the users and other stakeholders and serve as means for documenting the ideas behind the design of architectural components and their interfaces.}
\paragraph{The thesis involves the initial research on the available state-of-the-art Software Architecture documentation processes, tools, etc. that help in maintaining a software architecture documentation and keeping it consistent with the evolving architecture. Understanding the current software architecture documentation process at Mediawiki keeping the evaluation goals in mind is an essential part of this thesis work. It also focuses on critical evaluation of the documentation process to derive requirements for its improvement.}
\paragraph{Based on the analysis, review and interaction method, an improved Software Architecture documentation process will be proposed, implemented and evaluated. Initial work involves understanding the MediaWiki software architecture complexities from an open social software perspective. Then existing software processes are studied in order to present ideas for a better maintainable SA documentation process. The final step is to evaluate improvements of the process and the quality of documentation on grounds of maintainability, Accessibility, Consistency, Completeness, etc.}
