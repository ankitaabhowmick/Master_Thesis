\chapter{\abstractname}

The thesis involves the initial research on the available state-of-the-art Software Architecture documentation processes, tools, etc. that help in maintaining a software architecture documentation that is consistent with the evolving architecture.

Understanding the current software architecture documentation process at Wikimedia, keeping the evaluation goals in mind, is an essential part of this thesis. It also focuses on critical evaluation of the documentation process to derive requirements for its improvement.

Based on analysis, an improved Software Architecture documentation process will be proposed and evaluated.
